# whichbinsthisweek

I can never remember which bins I need to put out each week.  I'm too stubborn to go and look which bins my neighbours have put out, I don't trust them anyway, and I have to go through 50 unnecessary steps in order for the council website to tell me.

To avoid all that faff, I've built this low-hassle web app to instantly tell me which bins it is this week!
